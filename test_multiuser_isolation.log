                        TEST SUMMARY
================================================================

Environment:
  PostgreSQL client (psql): 17.7 (Ubuntu 17.7-0ubuntu0.25.04.1)
  PostgreSQL server: PostgreSQL 17.7 (Ubuntu 17.7-0ubuntu0.25.04.1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 14.2.0-19ubuntu2) 14.2.0, 64-bit
  pg_repack extension: 1.5.2

User Privilege Configuration:
  repack_user1: CAN run pg_repack
  repack_user2: CAN run pg_repack
  no_repack_user: CANNOT run pg_repack

Test Results:

During Initial Data Copy (Transaction Uncommitted):
  TEST 1 (repack_user2 → repack_user1 log table): PASS
  TEST 2 (repack_user2 → repack_user1 intermediate table metadata): PASS
  TEST 3 (repack_user2 → repack_user1 source table): PASS
  TEST 4 (no_repack_user → repack schema access): PASS
  TEST 5 (no_repack_user → data access protection): PASS
  TEST 6 (no_repack_user → repack_user1 source table): PASS
  TEST 7 (repack_user1 → own log table, CAN access): PASS
  TEST 8 (repack_user1 → own intermediate table, serializable txn): PASS
  TEST 9 (repack_user1 → own source table, CAN access): PASS

After Copy Completion (Table Visible in pg_class):
  TEST 10 (repack_user2 → intermediate table, BLOCKED): PASS
  TEST 11 (repack_user2 → log table, BLOCKED): PASS
  TEST 12 (no_repack_user → intermediate table, BLOCKED): PASS
  TEST 13 (no_repack_user → log table, BLOCKED): PASS
  TEST 14 (repack_user1 → own intermediate table, CAN access): PASS
  TEST 15 (repack_user1 → own log table, CAN access): PASS

Note: TEST 14-15 prove pg_repack is still in progress (owner can access intermediate objects).
      TEST 8 demonstrates serializable transaction isolation (MVCC).
      TEST 1-6 and 10-13 prove privilege isolation (ownership-based protection).

================================================================
                    ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
================================================================

Conclusion: pg_repack properly isolates intermediate tables
both during and after the data copy phase.

Key findings:
  • During copy: Protected by transaction isolation (MVCC)
  • After copy: Protected by table ownership permissions
  • Concurrent updates: Properly captured in log table
  • Neither repack_user2 nor no_repack_user could access repack_user1's data
